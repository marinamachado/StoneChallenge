# Data Intern Challenge

This is Conta Stone's data challenge for intern applicants. The objective is to extract and analyze data from a database.

## Instructions

The solution can be developed using Python, SQL scripts, a BI tool or a combination of those. 
It must be hosted in a public code repository such as **GitHub** and **GitLab**, or sent as a compressed `.zip` folder including all the necessary files to replicated your environment and run your code.

The database is available as CSVs in this gist and contains credit card transactional data in 4 tables:

- `customers`
- `cards`
- `transactions`
- `frauds`

1. Extract and analyze the data in order to answer the following questions. Provide a description and/or comments for each solution.

- What is the average `age` of the customers in the database?
- How is the `card_family` ranked based on the `credit_limit` given to each card?
- For the transactions flagged as fraud, what are the `id`s of the transactions with the highest value?

2. Analysis:

- Analyze whether or not the fraudulent transactions are somehow associated to other features in the dataset. Explain your results.

**It is not mandatory to answer all questions.**
